### Google website rebuild
For this project I will be rebuilding the google search page.

1. Inside project folder create index.html
2. Start by just putting the main elements on the page (logo image, search form, buttons)
3. Get them placed horizontally
4. Either download the Google logo or link directly to the URL on the web in the <img> tag
5. Next do the navbar across the top,
    * First build the content
    * Then position 
    * If you are lost use this link [Navbar Help](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp)
6. Last put in the footer, which should be similar to the top navbar.
7. Push to github
